 Optimization: Introduction of ParticleManager for Consolidated Particle System Configurations

 Description:

 This update presents a major step in improving the performance of the game by introducing an efficient management of particle systems via a dedicated ParticleManager class.

 Changes:

 ParticleManager Class: This class is the centralized location where we define and manage our particle system configurations. Instead of creating configurations on-the-fly, they are now predefined within this class and can be accessed when needed, thereby reducing computational overhead.

 Static Particle Systems: We've defined the configurations for different particle systems like lasers, missile trails, and explosions as static properties in the ParticleManager. This means we can use these configurations throughout our game without creating new ones each time, which significantly reduces memory usage and boosts rendering performance.

 Functions for Dynamic Configurations: For the particle systems that require more dynamic properties, such as color for missile trails, we have defined functions that return configured particle systems. This gives us the best of both worlds, maintaining the performance benefits of static configurations and providing flexibility where required.

 Applied Changes: We've applied these changes across the Laser, GhostMissile, and Explosion classes, which now utilize the ParticleManager for their particle systems.

 These improvements should result in noticeable performance gains, particularly in high-intensity scenes with many active particle systems.

 Future Work:

 Continued optimization is a priority and we'll be monitoring performance while searching for additional optimization opportunities. This pattern of utilizing static configurations where possible, and functions for more dynamic configurations, could potentially be applied to other shared resources within the game.
